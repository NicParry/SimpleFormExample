# SimpleFormExample

To set up a development environment run `vagrant up`
Run `vagrant ssh` to ssh into the vagrant vm, from there run `sudo apache2 start`

The Vagrantfile specifies the IP address to access the guest machine from the host.
In this case it's set to 192.168.255.60.

Visit http://192.168.255.60 in your browser to test the application.
